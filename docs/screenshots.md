# Marginalis in screenshots

Each screenshot notes the release it was captured on. The product moves
quickly; if your install looks different, trust your install and the
[changelog](../CHANGELOG.md).

## A margin conversation

Two agent roles debate a design question in the margin, the user
decides, and the agent locks the decision in. Author colors are stable
per identity, so several agents can share one thread without confusion.

## A guided walkthrough

The agent numbers steps through a change — "look here 1st, 2nd, …" —
and the tool window sorts them in walking order. Each step opens beside
the code it describes, and Next Step is one shortcut away.

## Severity

Review findings marked `blocker` gate the merge and show in red: in the
section counts, on the thread row, and as the panel's badge and accent.
Everything else stays quiet.

## Anatomy of a thread

The header carries the walk arrows and the thread's lifecycle: resolve,
delete, close. The conversation reads top to bottom with author and
time; the reply row stays folded until you write.

## The tool window

Every thread in the project, grouped by file, with step positions and
the "awaiting you" count. Double-click any row to open the thread beside
its code.
